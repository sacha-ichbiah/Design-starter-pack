# Design for Developers Starter Pack

Design is both an art and a science.

Design is about building things, solving problems, and conveying messages. It is a craft that relies on centuries of empirical knowledge, common practices, and usages.

Design should be accessible to everyone.

Here is a minimalistic set of concepts and tools to help you get started.

## Core Concepts:
Understanding core concepts will broaden your understanding of many things, including good software design. In summary, design is a science of consistency. It's about establishing rules and sometimes breaking them to convey messages.
- [Design for Developers](https://joyofcode.xyz/design-for-developers) — An overview of design from a developer's perspective.
- [Design Systems 101 - What is a Design System?](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-101-what-is-a-design-system/) and [Design Systems 102 - How to Build Your Design System](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-102-how-to-build-your-design-system/) — Two foundational articles from Figma loaded with insights on building things in general.
- [C.R.A.P](https://vwo.com/blog/crap-design-principles/) — A concise overview of the CRAP principles: Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, Proximity.

## Tools:
Design is about craftsmanship. You will have to master your tools if you want to be good at it. 
- [Figma](http://figma.com) — A good design operating system.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) — A website to explore different fonts and integrate them easily into your websites.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) — A simple way to implement CSS in web applications.
- [Scikit Image](https://scikit-image.org) and [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Sometimes a simple Python script is the fastest way to get stuff done.

## Colors: 
Colors are crucial to create your visual identity. There are very simple rules that helps creating nice color palettes. 
- [Canvas Color Picker](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) — A tool for choosing and manipulating colors.
- [Building Your Color Palette](https://www.refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette) - A tutorial to design a color palette.
- [Designing accessible color systems](https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems) - An article explaining how stripe managed contrast constraints when designing its systems.
- [Tailwind default palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) - Tailwind default palette is perceptually uniform. This is a great place to start.

## Icons
Icons are essential tools for visual communication, but they must be used carefully to avoid inconsistency and unclear messaging.
- [A Complete Guide to Iconography](https://www.designsystems.com/iconography-guide/) - Everything you need to get started.
- [Design Principles for Icons](https://m3.material.io/styles/icons/designing-icons) - Key principles for crafting intuitive icons. 

## Animations:
Animations can attract attention but be mindful of potential pitfalls like overly slow, long, or complex animations.
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) — A JavaScript library for creating 2D animations.
- [three.js](https://threejs.org) — A JavaScript library for 3D animations, requiring some knowledge of computer graphics and geometry.
